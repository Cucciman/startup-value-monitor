# Startup Value Monitor (MVP)

An open-source tool to compare the real value of European startups across crowdfunding platforms and public markets.

## Methodology
We normalize to EUR, align sectors/stages, compute EV/Revenue for crowdfunding and compare to public comps. The headline metric is the Valuation Gap Index (VGI) = median CF multiple / median public multiple.
